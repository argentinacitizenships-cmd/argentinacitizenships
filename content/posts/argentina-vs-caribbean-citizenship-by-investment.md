## Why Compare Argentina and the Caribbean?

For decades, Caribbean nations such as St. Kitts & Nevis, Dominica, Grenada, Antigua & Barbuda, and St. Lucia have dominated the citizenship-by-investment (CBI) landscape. Their programs offer fast approvals, modest investment thresholds, and reliable global mobility. With Argentina’s CBI program launching under Decree 524/2025, investors now have a powerful G20 alternative that blends credibility, Mercosur access, and U.S. E-2 eligibility.

This guide walks through the critical differences so you can determine which path aligns best with your long-term objectives.

## Key Differences at a Glance

- **Economic credibility:** Argentina is a G20 economy with broad diplomatic ties; Caribbean programs operate in smaller island nations.  
- **Visa-free mobility:** Argentina’s passport provides 172+ destinations, rivalling or exceeding Caribbean passports.  
- **Mercosur access:** Argentine citizens can live and work freely across Mercosur member states—an advantage the Caribbean cannot match.  
- **Program stability:** Caribbean programs have faced increased EU and UK scrutiny. Argentina’s program derives authority from a major national government.  
- **U.S. E-2 visa eligibility:** Argentina’s passport qualifies for the E-2 treaty investor visa; among the Caribbean, only Grenada enjoys this benefit.

## Investment Requirements Compared

| Program                            | Minimum Investment (USD) | Notes                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Argentina**                      | ~$500,000 (TBA)          | Directed toward government-approved projects supporting economic growth |
| **St. Kitts & Nevis**              | $250,000                 | Sustainable Island State Contribution (SISC)                          |
| **Dominica**                       | $200,000                 | Economic Diversification Fund or real estate                          |
| **Grenada**                        | $220,000                 | National Transformation Fund or real estate                           |
| **St. Lucia**                      | $240,000                 | National Economic Fund or real estate                                 |
| **Antigua & Barbuda**              | $235,000                 | National Development Fund or all-inclusive real estate                |

Caribbean programs deliver lower entry costs. Argentina balances the higher threshold with a G20 passport, Mercosur mobility, and a 30-day decision window mandated by Decree 524/2025.

## Mobility & Lifestyle Considerations

**Argentina:**  
- Visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 172+ destinations including the EU, UK, Ireland, Japan, Singapore, and much of Asia.  
- Ongoing negotiations to rejoin the U.S. Visa Waiver Program would further elevate mobility.  
- Automatic freedom of movement and work across Mercosur (Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, plus associate members).

**Caribbean CBI Programs:**  
- 140–155 destinations, including the EU and UK.  
- No Mercosur benefits.  
- Under scrutiny from EU governing bodies, which could affect future Schengen access if programs fail to meet transparency standards.

## U.S. E-2 Investor Visa Access

- **Argentina:** Treaty nation—citizens can pursue the E-2 visa to live and operate a business in the United States.  
- **Caribbean:** Only Grenada currently maintains E-2 treaty status with the U.S.

## Residency and Taxation

- **Argentina:** No residency requirement is expected before or after citizenship approval. Argentina taxes on residency rather than citizenship, so non-resident citizens are generally not taxed on foreign income.  
- **Caribbean:** Likewise no residency requirement; most Caribbean programs do not tax non-resident citizens on foreign income.

## Due Diligence & Processing Times

| Aspect                         | Argentina                                         | Caribbean Programs                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decision timeline**         | Mandated 30 business days once application files | Typically 3–6 months depending on jurisdiction           |
| **Due diligence**             | Multi-agency: Agency for Citizenship by Investment Programs, Immigration, Financial Crimes Unit | External due diligence firms contracted by each jurisdiction |
| **Program oversight**         | Ministry of Economy with cross-agency cooperation | Individual CBI units within each island nation           |

## Which Program Fits Your Strategy?

- **Choose Argentina if you want** a G20 passport, Mercosur mobility, E-2 eligibility, and a government-backed program with strong diplomatic credibility.  
- **Choose the Caribbean if you need** the lowest investment threshold, prefer established real estate or donation routes, and are comfortable with the compliance frameworks already in place.

Many global families are opting for a dual approach: keeping an existing Caribbean passport for quick travel while securing Argentina’s citizenship for long-term credibility and regional access.
