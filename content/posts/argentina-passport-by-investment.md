## From Residency to Direct Citizenship

Traditionally, Argentina has been known for its relatively accessible naturalization process, allowing residents to apply for citizenship after roughly two years of living in the country. The new Citizenship by Investment framework, however, introduces a direct pathway to citizenship without requiring prior residence.

Under Decree 524/2025, qualified foreign investors will be able to make an approved investment (expected to start at around USD 500,000) and apply directly for citizenship, bypassing the conventional multi-year residency stage.

For a detailed breakdown of the legal foundations and requirements, see _Argentina Citizenship by Investment - 2026 Official Guide & Early Updates_.

## Visa-Free Access Overview

Argentina’s global mobility privileges extend across nearly every major world region. Here’s what new citizens can expect with an Argentina passport by investment:

| Region | Visa-Free Access Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| **Europe** | Schengen Zone (90 days), United Kingdom, Ireland, Balkans |
| **Americas** | Canada (eTA pending), Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile |
| **Middle East** | Israel, Turkey, UAE (90-day entry permitted) |
| **Africa** | South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco |

Once the U.S. visa waiver reinstatement is complete, Argentina’s mobility network will rival that of EU member states such as Portugal or Greece.

## Regional Advantage Through Mercosur

Beyond global travel, one of Argentina’s most overlooked benefits is its regional integration through Mercosur, the South American trade bloc.

Citizens of Argentina are automatically granted the right to live and work in Mercosur member countries like Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay without the need for a separate visa or permit.

This makes the Argentina passport by investment particularly attractive to entrepreneurs and remote professionals seeking to expand their business or lifestyle options across Latin America.

## Comparison with Caribbean CBI Passports

Caribbean citizenship programs such as St. Kitts & Nevis, Dominica, and Grenada have long been favored by investors seeking quick second passports.

However, Argentina’s offering could surpass them in perceived legitimacy, visa-free power, and regional advantages.

While Caribbean passports provide access to 140-155 destinations, Argentina exceeds 170+, including visa-free access to the Schengen Zone and advanced Asian markets.

Additionally, Caribbean programs have faced increased scrutiny from the EU and UK, leading to tighter vetting and reduced credibility in certain financial and immigration circles. Argentina, as a G20 economy with established diplomatic relations, offers investors a more stable and globally respected alternative.

For a detailed comparison, see _Argentina vs Caribbean Citizenship by Investment (Comparison Guide)_.

## Dual Citizenship and Tax Benefits

Unlike many other nations, Argentina permits dual citizenship without restrictions. Investors do not need to renounce their existing nationality when obtaining Argentine citizenship.

Furthermore, Argentina taxes are based on residency, not citizenship. This means that individuals who obtain citizenship but reside abroad are generally not subject to tax on foreign-sourced income, which is a crucial factor for international investors.

To understand the tax and legal implications in more depth, see _Argentina Dual Citizenship: Rules, Taxes, and Legal Considerations for Investors_.

## Future Outlook

As final regulations are published, Argentina’s new CBI program is expected to attract investors seeking both mobility and legitimacy.

Its combination of fast-track processing (30 business days), competitive investment levels, and strong diplomatic reputation make it a natural successor to programs that have recently closed or faced tightening restrictions.

If the U.S. Visa Waiver reinstatement proceeds as planned, Argentina will likely emerge as one of the most valuable citizenships available by investment in 2025.

Argentina’s newly announced Citizenship by Investment (CBI) program is rapidly positioning the country as a serious player in global investment migration. Through the Argentina passport by investment, qualified investors can soon obtain one of the most respected Latin American passports, pairing broad visa-free access with a family-friendly pathway and strong international recognition.

While the program—enacted under Presidential Decree 524/2025—is still finalizing its technical regulations, its global appeal is already clear. Argentina combines world-class mobility with competitive costs, the same ingredients that helped other citizenship programs thrive.

## The Power of the Argentine Passport

The Argentine passport consistently ranks among the world’s strongest. As of 2025 it grants visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to more than 172 destinations, including:

- All 27 countries of the Schengen Area
- The United Kingdom and Ireland
- Japan, Singapore, and most of East Asia
- Nearly all of Latin America

Argentina’s government is also working to rejoin the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. Once reinstated, Argentine citizens will be able to visit the United States for up to 90 days without a visa—placing the passport among the top 15 globally for mobility.

## From Residency to Direct Citizenship

Historically, Argentina has been known for a relatively accessible naturalization process in which residents could apply for citizenship after roughly two years of living in the country. The new Citizenship by Investment framework introduces a direct pathway to citizenship without requiring prior residence.

Under Decree 524/2025, eligible foreign investors will make an approved investment (expected to start around USD 500,000) and apply directly for citizenship, bypassing the conventional multi-year residency stage.

## Dual Citizenship and Tax Benefits

Unlike many countries, Argentina fully permits dual citizenship. Investors do not have to renounce their existing nationality when they obtain an Argentine passport.

Argentina also taxes on the basis of residency rather than citizenship. Individuals who become citizens but live abroad are generally not taxed on foreign-sourced income—a crucial differentiator for global investors.

## Future Outlook

As final regulations are published, Argentina’s new CBI program is expected to attract investors who want both mobility and legitimacy. Its combination of fast-track processing (30 business days), competitive investment thresholds, and strong diplomatic reputation make it a natural successor to programs that have recently closed or faced tighter restrictions.

If the U.S. Visa Waiver reinstatement proceeds as planned, Argentina will likely emerge as one of the most valuable citizenships available by investment in 2025.
